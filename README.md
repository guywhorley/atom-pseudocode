# atom-pseudocode
This project contains my intial foray into atom themes and language packages.

The theme/language combination is meant to highlight a range of general pseudocode keywords, along with associated color syntax.

The theme is dark.

Currently, neither the language nor theme packages conform to the Atom package standards required  for inclusion into the online package catalog.
